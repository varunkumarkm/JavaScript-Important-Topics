Visual studio - It is used to write our code, show our code and easily to debug the code
Node-js - it using to run our code, we need some environament, So node-js is a javascript engine 
          in which we run our code

javascript - javascript is a flexible language
* why we using a single cotes and double cotes in javascript
-> Because when we declaring a string we using single and double cotes, But when we using 'varun's phone'
like this we got confused, that's why at the time we using "varun's phone" .         

Variables:
 * We want to store the data from temprory purpose, we using the variables.
 * Once we store the values on varibles we using multiple times.
 * A variable can have store characters, numbers, numbers can use any where but not first character.
 * A variable can have store a special symbols are: $ and _
 * We can declearnig variable name as camel case.

note - All our javascript code is convert into machine code
 
let - A let is a keykowrd, using which we create a variable.
const - A constant is keyword which we create a constant variables or values
ex: pi value is 3.14, we using const pi = 3.14, we can't able to change the pi value

Data types:
-> The most important thing of any software is data, Because most of the application we build it in data
we store it and processing it.
ex: if we want to create a game, graph it's all about data
In javascript we divided into data types is two parts are:
1) primitive data types
2) Object data types

1) primitive data types: 
* Number * String * Boolean * Null * Undefined * Symbol

1) Number - * In numbers we want to find the math operations, whatever we can
            * The maximum value of numbers are: 1.7976931348623157e+308, other than more value we use BigInt
            * Maximum safe value 9007199254740991
   Base number system:
   base10 - decimal(0-9)
   base2 - binary(0&1)
   base8 - octal(0-7)
   base16 - hexadecimal(0-9 and A-F)       

   Example for hexadecimal value are 
   let num = 0xff
   console.log(num)//255
    (ff)16 = (15*16^1) + (15*16)^0
    FF16 is the given hex number,
    16 in FF16 represents the base-16 or hexadecimal number system,
    25510 is the decimal equivalent of hex FF,
    10 in 25510 represents the base-10 or decimal number system.

2) String: The + operate is very smart it checks weather its string or number, is it String it will concatinated
            if its number it will addition for example for String
 
3) Boolean: It means either it will true or false

History of javascript programming language

NetsCape company       NetsCape Navigator-2 
Mocha -> LiveScript -> javascript from 1995 -> ECAMA(European computer manufacturing association)international
-> ECAMAScript -> ECAMAScript 1 launched 1997 -> 1999 NetsCape sold to AoI launched firefox browser and
ECAMAScript 3 -> ECAMAScript 3.1 -> micromedia launch ECAMAScript 4 -> 2005 we got AJAX
(Single page application, SPA) -> 2008 google launch a chrome browser with V8 engine, this browser is 
compiled and interpreted and just in time compiler, It's comes to right time for javascript, 
Because javascript has a interpreted language, Now the javascript is a easy language and it is fast
So in order to run javascript file directly in os and that's we got new environament Node-js.
Node-js - node-js is a engine where we run our javascript file, Now the javascript have a boosting and 
then introduces since 2009 ECAMAScript 5, someone called it as modern javascriptc, Now we are in 2015 new  
features ECAMAScript 6, after onwards so many versions is comming up, But we most popularly we used 
ECAMAScript 6, Now the current version of ECAMAScript 12
who owns the trademark of javascript is ORACLE

MicroSoft company
introduces a name a jScript, it works on internrt explore 

Type Conversion and type Coercion:
-> It means we convert a one data type into another data type

when we using (==) and (===)
operators(==) - data, but type we cannot
operators(===) - we checket in type and as well

logical operator - we want to compare two operators that's why we using logical operator
we are using And (&) OR (|) and Not (!)
* And(&) operator: (T, T)sunday, camera is charged, In this scenaio both are required
* OR(|) operator : camera is charged, phone also charged, Either of one
* Not(!) operator: we taking both camera and phone give a true, or else false

What is Loop
-> ex: everyday we eat, everyday we dirnk water that is the loop
Types of Loops are:
* while loop - First check for the conditions, we don't know the starting and ending point, we use while loop 
* Do while loop - First Execute the block then check for the conditions
* for loop - we know the starting point and ending point, we use loop

Which one is the best loop compare to while loop and for loop
-> Every loop is an own drawbacks and advantages
So, if we know the starting value, we know the ending value, we know the iterations for loop is the best
ex: if want to print the value 1-100 for loop is the best

function - The function is a object data type, other than primitive data type is object data type

Global variable - we created outside the function, we will call it as global variable
Local variable - created inside the function, So we will call it as local variable
                 for local variable is created inside the () or inside the block

this keyword - this represents the current object, If I want any of the property of the object always 
               refers to a this keyword

Array methods - push, pop, shift
push - it means add the element into the Array
pop - it means stach first in and first out
shift - shift does a removes a element from the first
unshift - it will add a element at the beginning
splice - it does a removing a element by step by step based on our requirement, and removing an element 
based on our requirement
